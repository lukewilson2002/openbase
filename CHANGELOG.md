# Changelog

All notable changes to OpenBase are listed here. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) and the project uses
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/). While the major version is 0, a new minor
version (0.2.0) may contain breaking changes; read its notes before upgrading.

Releases are published from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/lukewilson2002/openbase/releases)
(see [docs/releasing.md](docs/releasing.md)). Write changes under **Unreleased** as you go;
`scripts/release.sh X.Y.Z` turns that section into the release's.

## [Unreleased]

### Fixed

- Phones: tapping a text field no longer zooms the page in on iOS (form fields are 16px on touch
  screens and narrow windows), and the base's top bar no longer makes the page wider than a small
  phone. Buttons, menu items and the view list are larger on touch screens, the view options button
  is always visible there, and the expanded record scrolls as one column below tablet width.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-10-13

First release. OpenBase is a self-hosted alternative to Airtable for individuals and very
small businesses, in one Rust binary with the web client embedded and a SQLite database.

### Added

- Accounts and administration: first-run setup (the first account is the administrator),
  invite-only or open sign-up, session management, password reset, passkey (WebAuthn)
  sign-in, TOTP two-factor authentication, profiles with time zones, personal access tokens,
  admin pages for users, outgoing email (SMTP), instance stats, the audit log and backups.
- Workspaces with five roles (owner, creator, editor, commenter, viewer), per-base sharing,
  invites by link or email, read-only view share links and public form links.
- Bases, tables and 28 field types, including linked records, formulas (Airtable-compatible
  syntax and function list), lookups, rollups, attachments with thumbnails and autonumber.
- Records: batch create, edit, delete and restore, comments with @mentions, per-record
  history, copy and paste, fill handle, undo and redo, search and a 30-day trash.
- Views: grid, form, gallery, kanban, calendar, timeline and list, each with nested filters,
  sorts, grouping, field layout, summaries and CSV export.
- Live collaboration over Server-Sent Events.
- Automations: record, form, schedule (cron) and webhook triggers; create-record,
  update-record, email, HTTP-request (with SSRF protection) and notification actions.
- An Airtable-compatible REST API under `/api/v1` and an MCP server at `/mcp` (about 70
  tools) with built-in OAuth 2.1 sign-in for AI assistants such as Claude and ChatGPT.
- CSV import and export.
- Operations: daily automatic backups with retention, `openbase backup` and `openbase restore`,
  an automatic database snapshot before every schema migration, a health endpoint
  (`/api/health`, which also reports the version) and `openbase healthcheck`.
- Deployment: a container image, a docker-compose stack with Caddy for automatic HTTPS, and a
  hardened systemd unit.

## [0.1.0-rc.2] - 2026-10-13

Second release candidate for OpenBase 0.1.0. It replaces 0.1.0-rc.1, whose release build
stopped at the end-to-end test gate and published nothing. It contains everything listed under
0.1.0 below. Not recommended for production use yet.

### Fixed

- Grid: right after "Add record", a delayed selection of the new row could move the selection
  under your next click, which then opened a cell editor or sent your typing to the button.

### Changed

- The release build now refuses to publish when any end-to-end test only passes on a retry.
- `scripts/release.sh` writes changelog links only to tags that exist and refuses to cut a
  release without notes under Unreleased.

## [0.1.0-rc.1] - 2026-10-13

### Added

- Release candidate for OpenBase 0.1.0, published to test the release pipeline end to end
  (native amd64 and arm64 builds, the `ghcr.io/lukewilson2002/openbase` image with provenance
  and SBOM attestations, and Linux binaries with checksums). It contains everything listed
  under 0.1.0 below. Not recommended for production use yet.
